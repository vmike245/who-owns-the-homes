          <h2>What is this?</h2>
          <p>
            This is a map of every property that is owned by a landlord. I have
            defined a landlord as someone who owns more than 1 property or has LLC
            or Trust in the name of the owner. This map should help illustrate how
            much property in Denver is owned as "an investment".

          <h3>How to use</h3>
          <p>
            Click on a marker to view the address, owner name, and the other
            properties that person owns.

          <h3>How can I verify this information?</h3>

            All of this information is publicly available and verifiable at

          <h3>Things of Note</h3>
          <p>Since this list is compiled by owner, there are owners that some
            people may not typically consider landlords. Owners like the "CITY &
            COUNTY OF DENVER" or "SCHOOL DISTRICT NO 1". I left those in the
            data set because I didn't want to accidentally remove one that
            sounds like it is a government entity when really it is a private
            entity.</p>

          <h3>Mile High View</h3>
          <p>
            02/18/2021: After a first pass it appears that between 25% - 33% of
            home on any given block in Denver are rentals. Which would mean that 1
            out of every 3 or 4 Denverites are renters

          <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
          <p>
            My partner and I are trying to buy a home in Denver. We have been
            planning and saving for a few years and we recently started actively
            searching for what we hope to be our forever home. We watched as house
            after house was purchased significantly above list price and we
            wondered who could be buying these homes? I was interested in learning
            how many properties in Denver were owned by people with multiple
            properties so I figured this would be a neat project. I had an inkling
            that might be who we would be competing with but I was surprised at
            how pervasive landlord and investor owned properties are.
